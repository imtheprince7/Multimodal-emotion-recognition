Ses02F_script01_3,M026,218.09,223.28,It takes some time for a guy to toss that off.  'Cause they weren't just men.,sad
Ses02F_script01_3,M027,224.16,238.3,"For instance, one time, it had been raining several days and this kid came to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks.  I put them in pocket.  It's only a little thing, but that's the kind of guys I had.",sad

Ses02F_script01_3,M031,274.75,290.06,Then I came back and it was incredible.  There was no meaning in it here.  The whole thing to them seemed like sort of a bus accident.  I went to work with Dad and that rat race again.,sad
Ses02F_script01_3,M032,290.35,307.67,"And I felt what you said, ashamed somehow 'cause nobody was changered at all.  It seemed to make suckers out of a lot of guys.  I felt wrong to be alive to open the new bank book, drive the new car, see the new refrigerator.",sad
Ses02F_script01_3,M033,308.71,320.45,"I mean, you can take those things out of a war, but when you drive that car, you've gotta know that it came out of the love a man can have for a man.  You've gotta be a little better because of it.",sad
Ses02F_script01_3,M034,320.83,330.73,Because otherwise all you have is really loot and there's blood on it.  And I didn't want to take any of it.  And I guess that included you.,sad
